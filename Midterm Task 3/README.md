# Midtern Lab Task 3: Creating PIVOT TABLE and DASHBOARD
- Focusing on building the Dashboard with the necessary Pivot Tables, charts, and interactivity using slicers. I'll break down the steps to ensure clarity:

## STEP 1: Data Preperation
- Load Data: Open Worksheet on Uncleaned DS Jobs and the transform tables.

## STEP 2: Pivot Table Creation

## STEP 3 - DESIGN YOUR DASHBOARD
*Insert Chart*:

- Salary by Role Chart: Select your PivotTable for Salary by Role, and then go to Insert > Recommended Charts. Choose a Bar Chart or Column Chart for this.
- Salary by State Chart: Similarly, select the PivotTable for Salary by State and insert a Bar Chart or Column Chart.
- Salary by Size Chart: Use a Pie Chart or Bar Chart for visualizing Salary by Size.
*Map Chart*:
- If you want to use a Map Chart for Salary by State, select the State and Salary data from your PivotTable, and then go to Insert > Maps > Filled Map. Ensure that your state names are recognized by Excel for map generation.

## STEP 4 - INSERT SLICER FOR INTERACTIVITY
*Insert Slices*:

- Select a PivotTable (e.g., Salary by Role) and go to Insert > Slicer.
- Choose the fields you want to filter by, such as State, Size, or Role.
- Repeat this for other PivotTables as needed.

## STEP 5 - APPLY DESIGN AND COLOR CUSTOMIZATIONS
Color Customization: Home → Cell Styles or manually color chart elements. Chart Design: Select chart → Chart Tools → Design.

## STEP 6 - Make the Dashboard Interactive
